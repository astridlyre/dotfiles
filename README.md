# My Dotfiles

As in the Linux tradition, here are my dotfiles. Since I'm just starting my journey
(learning to code and how to use Linux) there is not much here.

## About Me

I'm teaching myself how to code, and how to use Linux. I'm using Arch Linux, which is good
entry into the Linux world, and offers a customizable experience. In the spirit of
learning, I am using `bspwm` and other such tools to force me to configure things on my
own.

## Some of the Applications I am using

- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) text editor
- bash
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) terminal emulator
- [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) window manager
- [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar) bar
- [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) window switcher / program launcher
- [zathura](https://github.com/pwmt/zathura) document reader
- [brave](https://brave.com/) web browser
- pcmanfm gui file manager

## Contact
