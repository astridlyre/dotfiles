# My Dotfiles

As in the Linux tradition, here are my dotfiles. Since I'm just starting my journey
(learning to code and how to use Linux) there is not much here.

## About Me

I'm teaching myself how to code, and how to use Linux. I'm using Arch Linux, which is good
entry into the Linux world, and offers a customizable experience. In the spirit of
learning, I am using `bspwm` and other such tools to force me to configure things on my
own.

## My Current Tools

At the moment I'm using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for my text editor. Future goals
include figuring out the built-in LSP. I use `bash` for my shell, and `alacritty` for my
terminal emulator. I have spent a while learning JavaScript, along with web development.
Some of the resources I've been using are:

- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/), a free online course from the University of Helsinki. This course focused on React and Nodejs.
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/), a free online JavaScript tutorial and reference.

  I have found the documentation of [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
  to be superb.

- [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) is a fantastic
  source for learning Test-driven-development in the Go programming language.
- [Bash Academy](https://guide.bash.academy) is where I have been learning how Linux shell
  scripting works.
- [Linux Professional Institute](https://www.lpi.org/) is where I have been learning more
  general Linux knowledge.

## Contact

I am always looking for new programming friends to learn from and share ideas with. My
website is [flat9.dev](https://flat9.dev).
