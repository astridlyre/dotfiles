# My Dotfiles

As in the Linux tradition, here are my dotfiles. Since I'm just starting my journey
(learning to code and how to use Linux) there is not much here.

## About Me

I'm teaching myself how to code, and how to use Linux. I'm using Pop! OS, which is an easy
entry into the Linux world, and offers a great tiling window manager experience without the
setup of i3 or other such tools. Eventually, I plan to install a few other distributions of
Linux to learn how to configure everything myself, but for the time being this set up is
working for me. The priority is to learn the more important aspects first, such as coding
and how computers work.

## My Current Tools

At the moment I'm using [Neovim](https://neovim.io/), but I have also been playing around with [SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/).
I use [Fish Shell](https://fishshell.com/), which while not POSIX compliant, is user friendly
and easy to use. The terminal I use is [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/index.html), a GPU based terminal emulator.
I have spent a while learning JavaScript, along with web development. Some of the
resources I've been using are:

- [Full Stack Open](https://fullstackopen.com/), a free online course from the University of Helsinki. This course focused on React and Nodejs.
- [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/), a free online JavaScript tutorial and reference.

  I have found the documentation of [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
  to be superb.

- [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/) is a fantastic
  source for learning Test-driven-development in the Go programming language.
- [Bash Academy](https://guide.bash.academy) is where I have been learning how Linux shell
  scripting works.
- [Linux Professional Institute](https://www.lpi.org/) is where I have been learning more
  general Linux knowledge.

## Contact

I am always looking for new programming friends to learn from and share ideas with. My
website is [flat9.dev](https://flat9.dev).
